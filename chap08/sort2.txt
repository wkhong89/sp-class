But when you come and I am filled with wonder,
each restless heart beats so imperfectly;
I am weak, when I am on your shoulders
Sometimes, I think I Glimpse eternity
Then, I am still and wait here in the silence
You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains
You raise me up to more than I can be
There is no life - no life without its hunger;
Until you come and sit awhile with me
When I am down and, oh my soul, so weary
When troubles come and my heart burdened be
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas
